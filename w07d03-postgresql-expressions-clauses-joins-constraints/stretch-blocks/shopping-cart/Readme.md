# Shopping Cart

The goal of this exercise is to build a shopping cart API.

## Release 0

Let's clone the cart functionality of any shopping site like Flipkart/Amazon/Shoppify etc
- Create a cart!!! Cart must be stored in backend database table(s).
- Store multiple items into it
- Also have a ministore of items that you've to add to the cart. Some of the items can be duplicate which lesser price(from some other retailer)
- So whenever you click on "Add to Cart". We are doing Operations like `SUM` that adds whatever exists inside of cart.
- Removing an item from cart should be supported

Note: You don't need to build any front end for this project. You can also use plugins for redundant stuff like auth etc.
